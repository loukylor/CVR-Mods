# Installation 
1. Simply follow the instructions on the [MelonLoader wiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) on installing MelonLoader **0.5.4** (MelonLoader is the mod loader which will allow my mods to run). 
2. Then download the mod(s) you would like to install from the [releases](https://github.com/loukylor/CVR-Mods/releases) section of this repository.
3. Allow the game to run once (this will set up a bunch of things MelonLoader uses)
4. And finally, drag and drop the downloaded mod(s) into the newly created `Mods` folder in the `ChilloutVR` folder and restart the game.
More detailed instructions and more mods can be found in the [ChilloutVR Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/dndGPM3bxu).
